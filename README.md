# Determination-of-Heart-Disease-Based-on-Analysis-of-Patient-Statistics-using-the-Fuzzy-C-means-Clus

The statistical characteristics of patients have a great influence on determining the likelihood of heart disease. 
To determine the disease in medical diagnostics, statistical methods are most often used Data Mining, which 
with large amounts of information and complex relationships can give more accurate estimates, especially with 
a large number of similar characteristics. In this paper, we consider the task of clustering data to determine the 
likelihood of heart disease for patients with similar characteristics. To solve the problem, the Fuzzy C-means 
method with normalization was used, and Python and the Pandas library were chosen to implement the 
algorithm. The developed software module allows visualization of the algorithm. This system also supports 
downloading and uploading data with the service according to safety requirements of data
